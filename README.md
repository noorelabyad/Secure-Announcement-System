# Secure-Announcement-System
<p align= "justify"> Vivado Webpack 2022.1 and 2 Basys3 FPGA Boards were used for this project. The first board (FPGA_1) is responsible for
the text input (using the keyboard), encryption and transmission, while the second board (FPGA_2) is responsible for receiving, decrypting and displaying the original, as well as, the encrypted text on the screen (using the VGA cable).
The ecryption and decryption of the 128-bit announcement was performed using Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES).</p>
